# Enroll devices by using a device enrollment manager account

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

Organizations can use Intune to manage large numbers of mobile devices with a single user account. The *device enrollment manager* (DEM) account is a special user account that can enroll up to 1,000 devices. You add existing users to the DEM account to give them the special DEM options. Each enrolled device uses a single license. We recommend that you use devices enrolled through this account as shared devices rather than personal ("BYOD") devices.  

Users must exist in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to be added as device enrollment managers. For optimal security, the DEM user shouldn't also be an Intune admin.

>[!NOTE]
>The DEM enrollment method can't be used with these other enrollment methods: [Apple Configurator with Setup Assistant](apple-configurator-setup-assistant-enroll-ios.md), [Apple Configurator with direct enrollment](apple-configurator-direct-enroll-ios.md), [Apple School Manager (ASM)](apple-school-manager-set-up-ios.md), or [Device Enrollment Program (DEP)](device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md).

## Example of a device enrollment manager scenario

A restaurant wants to provide 50 point-of-sale tablets for its wait staff, and order monitors for its kitchen staff. The employees never need to access company data or sign in as users. The Intune admin creates a new device enrollment manager account for the restaurant supervisor.  This account is separate from the supervisor's primary account and is used only for enrolling shared devices with Intune. The supervisor can now enroll the 50 tablets devices by using the DEM credentials.

Only users in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) can be device enrollment managers. The device enrollment manager user can't be an Intune admin.

The DEM user can:

-   Enroll unlimited devices in Intune
-   Sign in to the Company Portal to get company apps
-   Configure access to company data by deploying role-specific apps to the tablets

## Limitations of devices that are enrolled with a DEM account

Devices that are enrolled with a device enrollment manager account have the following limitations:

  - No per-user access. Because devices don't have an assigned user, the device has no email or company data access. VPN configurations, for example, could still be used to provide device apps with access to data.
  - The DEM user can't unenroll DEM-enrolled devices on the device itself by using the Company Portal. The Intune admin can do unenroll.
  - Only the local device appears in the Company Portal app or website.
  - Users canâ€™t use Apple Volume Purchase Program (VPP) apps with user licenses because of per-user Apple ID requirements for app management.
  - (iOS only) If you use DEM to enroll iOS devices, you can't use the Apple Configurator, Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP), or Apple School Manager (ASM) to enroll devices. This means that you can't put the device in supervised mode and thus won't have access to some configuration options.
  - (Android only) There's a limit to the number of Android work profile devices that can be enrolled with a single DEM account. Up to 10 Android work profile devices may be enrolled per DEM account. This limitation doesn't apply to legacy Android enrollment.
  - Devices can install VPP apps if they have device licenses.
  - An Intune device license isn't required to use DEM. Learn more about [user and device licenses](licenses-assign.md#how-user-and-device-licenses-affect-access-to-services).


> [!NOTE]
> You can deploy company apps to devices that are managed by the device enrollment manager. Deploy the Company Portal app as a **Required Install** to the device enrollment manager's user account.
> To improve performance, viewing the Company Portal app on a DEM device shows only the local device. Remote management of other DEM devices can only be done from the Intune admin console.

## Change DEM device limit number

1. In Azure Active Directory, choose **Devices** > **Device Settings**. Change the number of devices next to **Maximum number of devices per user**

2. To apply device restrictions for all other users, go to [Intune in the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/intuneportal) and choose **Device Enrollment** > **Enrollment restrictions** and configure your limits.

## Add a device enrollment manager

1.  In [Intune in the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/intuneportal), choose **Device enrollment** > **Device enrollment managers**.

2.  Select **Add**.

3.  On the **Add User** blade, enter a user principal name for the DEM user, and select **Add**. The DEM user is added to the list of DEM users.

## Permissions for DEM

Global or Intune Service Administrator Azure AD roles are required to
- complete tasks that are related to DEM enrollment in the Admin Portal
- see all DEM users despite RBAC permissions being listed and available under the custom User role.

A user without the Global Administrator or Intune Service Administrator role assigned, but who has read permissions for the Device Enrollment Managers role, can see only the DEM users they created. RBAC role support for these features will be announced in the future.


## Remove a device enrollment manager

When a device enrollment manager is removed:

-   Enrolled devices are unaffected and continue to be fully managed.
-   The removed DEM account credentials are still valid.
-   The removed DEM still can't wipe or retire devices.
-   The removed DEM can only enroll a number of devices up to the per-user limit configured by the Intune admin.

**To remove a device enrollment manager**

1. In [Intune in the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/intuneportal), choose **Device enrollment**, and then choose **Device enrollment managers**.
2. On the **Device enrollment managers** blade, select the DEM user, and select **Delete**.
